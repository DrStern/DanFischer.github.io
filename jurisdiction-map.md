# Jurisdiction & Service Area

The **61st District Court** serves the City of Grand Rapids. Our court’s jurisdiction is defined by **Michigan Compiled Laws (MCL 600.8101 et seq.)**, which splits the state into district‑court districts. Grand Rapids forms its own standalone district.

| Dimension | Scope |
|-----------|-------|
| **Geographic** | All land area within the corporate limits of the City of Grand Rapids. |
| **Subject‑Matter** | Misdemeanors, traffic & local‑ordinance violations, civil actions ≤ $25 000, small‑claims ≤ $6 500, landlord–tenant & land‑contract forfeiture, and felony preliminary proceedings. |
| **Personal** | Any defendant, plaintiff, or incident that arises within city boundaries (or for civil cases, where the defendant resides/does business in the city). |
