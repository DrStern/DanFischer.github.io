## After service: the defendant’s options

* **File an Answer** (within 21 days of service).  
* **File a Counter‑claim** or **Cross‑claim** if applicable.  
* **Negotiate a settlement** or request <strong>mediation</strong>.  
* <em>Do nothing</em> – The plaintiff may request a default judgment after 21 days.

## Pre‑trial conference &amp; mediation

Most general civil cases are scheduled for a brief **pre‑trial conference** to set deadlines and explore settlement.  
Cases under $5,000 are often referred to a **Community Dispute Resolution Center** for free or low‑cost mediation.

## Trial

If the case does not settle, it proceeds to a bench or jury trial.  
Parties must exchange exhibits and witness lists at least 14 days before trial.

## Collecting a judgment

* The court does <em>not</em> collect the money for you.  
* Common tools include **garnishment** of wages or bank accounts, and **seizure** of property by a court officer.  
* Judgments accrue <strong>post‑judgment interest</strong> set by statute.
