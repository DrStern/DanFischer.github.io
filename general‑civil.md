## What is a “general civil” case?

General Civil actions cover most **monetary disputes between private parties** that do **not** fall
into Small Claims, Landlord‑Tenant, or criminal categories.  
Typical issues include:

* Breach‑of‑contract or unpaid invoices  
* Property damage (vehicle repairs, pets, etc.)  
* Consumer claims / merchant disputes  
* Personal loans not repaid  
* Return of personal property (replevin)

**Jurisdiction limit:** The District Court may award up to **$25,000** in damages.  
Claims above that amount must be filed in Circuit Court.

## Steps to start a lawsuit

1. **Draft a Complaint** stating the facts, amount sought, and legal basis.  
2. **File the Complaint & Summons** with the Clerk; pay the filing fee (see below).  
3. **Serve** the defendant – usually by certified mail or process server.  
4. **Wait for an Answer** (21 days if served in Michigan; 28 days if out‑of‑state).  
5. **Pre‑trial conference & mediation** – many cases settle here.  
6. **Trial** (bench or jury).  
7. **Judgment & collection** if you prevail (garnishment, liens, etc.).
