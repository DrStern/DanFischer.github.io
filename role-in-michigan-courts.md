# Our Role in Michigan’s Court System

The 61st District Court serves the City of Grand Rapids and surrounding townships by providing first‑level judicial services for most criminal, traffic, and civil matters. We are often the public’s **first point of contact** with the judiciary.

## How We Fit in the Statewide Structure
1. **Arrest / Citation → District Court** – Arraignment, plea, discovery, motions, trial (for misdemeanors) or preliminary exam (for felonies).  
2. **Felony bind‑over** → 17th Circuit Court for trial & sentencing.  
3. **Appeals** – District‑court decisions may be appealed “by right” to Circuit Court, then to the Michigan Court of Appeals and the Michigan Supreme Court.  
4. **Administrative Oversight** – The State Court Administrative Office (SCAO) sets statewide policy, collects caseload data, and audits specialty courts for compliance.
