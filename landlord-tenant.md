    Most rental disputes in Michigan are handled in <strong>summary‑proceedings</strong>,
    a fast‑track court process designed to decide <em>possession</em> (who gets the
    property) and, if requested, unpaid <em>money damages</em>.

* **Retaliatory eviction** after complaints to housing officials.  
* **Discrimination** under fair‑housing laws.  
* **Warranty of habitability** violations (unsafe or uninhabitable unit).  

Tenants may also file a **counter‑claim** for damages such as overpaid rent or
security‑deposit violations.
