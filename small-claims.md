# Our Role in Michigan’s Court System

District courts are the judiciary’s “front door.” They handle the vast majority of criminal, traffic, and civil matters filed in Michigan.  
As a district court serving Grand Rapids, the **61st District Court** is responsible for early criminal proceedings, lower‑value civil disputes, and a range of problem‑solving programs that divert eligible participants away from traditional sentencing.

## Where We Fit in the Statewide Hierarchy

| **District Courts** | First appearance for most cases, misdemeanors through trial, felony arraignments & prelim exams, traffic, small civil matters. | DUI 1st, retail fraud, civil suit ≤ $25 k, eviction hearing. |
| **Circuit Courts** | Serious felonies through trial, higher‑value civil, family & juvenile jurisdiction, appeals from district court. | Felony assault, divorce, civil suit > $25 k. |
| **Court of Appeals** | Reviews legal errors from circuit (and some agency) decisions. | Appeal of circuit‑court verdict. |
| **Michigan Supreme Court** | Final interpreter of Michigan law; sets statewide rules, oversees the judiciary through the SCAO. | Establishes court‑rule changes, decides landmark appeals. |

## How We Fit in the Statewide Structure
1. **Arrest / Citation → District Court** – Arraignment, plea, discovery, motions, trial (for misdemeanors) or preliminary exam (for felonies).  
2. **Felony bind‑over** → 17th Circuit Court for trial & sentencing.  
3. **Appeals** – District‑court decisions may be appealed “by right” to Circuit Court, then to the Michigan Court of Appeals and the Michigan Supreme Court.  
4. **Administrative Oversight** – The State Court Administrative Office (SCAO) sets statewide policy, collects caseload data, and audits specialty courts for compliance.
