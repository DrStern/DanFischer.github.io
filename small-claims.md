## Before the hearing

* Parties may try **mediation** through a Community Dispute Resolution Center.  
* Either side can file a motion to **transfer** the case to the
  general‑civil docket (both sides may then hire attorneys).

## At the hearing

* Both parties testify under oath; each may present evidence and witnesses.  
* The magistrate or judge usually decides the case the same day.  

> **Right to appeal** – The <em>defendant</em> may appeal to District Court within
> 7 days; the <em>plaintiff</em> has no appeal right in small claims.

## Collecting your judgment

Winning a small‑claims case does not guarantee immediate payment.  
Tools to enforce payment include:

* **Wage garnishment**  
* **Bank garnishment**  
* **Seizure** of non‑exempt personal property  
* **Installment payment orders**

Fees for enforcement actions are added to the amount owed.
