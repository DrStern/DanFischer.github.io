## What is a “civil infraction”?

Most minor traffic violations and municipal code offenses are treated as **civil infractions** – not crimes.  
They carry monetary penalties (and sometimes driver‑license points) but **no jail time**.  
Examples include speeding, improper lane use, and failing to show proof of insurance.

## Your options after receiving a ticket 

1. **Admit responsibility & pay the fine** – settle online, by mail, or in person.  
2. **Admit with explanation** – ask the magistrate to lower the fine or points. No officer present.  
3. **Deny responsibility (informal hearing)** – you, the officer, and a magistrate. No attorneys.  
4. **Deny responsibility (formal hearing)** – held before a judge; attorneys allowed.

> **Deadline:** You must choose one of these options within **14 days** of the citation date.  
> Ignoring a ticket can lead to license suspension and added fees.

## Frequently asked questions

Only certain moving violations add points (see table above).  
Points stay on your record for **two years** from the conviction date.

<summary><strong>Can I take a driver‑safety course to avoid points?</strong></summary>

Yes. First‑time offenders for minor speeding (≤ 10 mph over) may be eligible for an
online Basic Driver Improvement Course that prevents points from appearing
on your public record. Ask the clerk when you pay or schedule a hearing.

The Court will enter a default judgment, add late fees, and the Secretary of
State may suspend your driver license. A clearance fee is required to reinstate.
