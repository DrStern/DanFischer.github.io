  <h1>Traffic &amp; Civil Infractions</h1>
  <p class="tagline">
    Tickets, fines, points, and your options for resolving non‑criminal offenses.
  </p>
</section>

<div class="card">
  <p>
    Most traffic tickets and local ordinance violations are treated as
    <strong>civil infractions</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; they are <em>not</em> crimes.  
    They carry monetary penalties (and sometimes driver‑license points) but
    <strong>no jail time</strong>.
  </p>
</div>

## Your options after receiving a ticket

1. **Admit responsibility &amp; pay the fine** – settle online, by mail, or in person.  
2. **Admit with explanation** – ask a magistrate to reduce the fine or points. No officer present.  
3. **Deny responsibility (informal hearing)** – you, the officer, and a magistrate. No attorneys.  
4. **Deny responsibility (formal hearing)** – held before a judge; attorneys allowed.

<div class="card">
  <p><strong>Deadline:</strong> You must choose <em>one</em> of these options within
  <strong>14&nbsp;days</strong> of the citation date. Ignoring a ticket can lead to license
  suspension and added fees.</p>
</div>

## Paying online

You can pay most civil‑infraction fines securely through our  
[**Online Payments portal →**](/online-payments){: .apply-btn }

## Points &amp; your driving record

* Points are assessed by the Secretary of State, not the court.  
* Points stay on your record for **two years** from the conviction date.  
* Six points in two years may trigger a Driver Responsibility assessment.  
* Twelve points can lead to license suspension.

## What if I need more time?

Contact the Court Clerk’s Office <em>before</em> the 14‑day deadline to request an
extension or a payment plan. Extensions are not guaranteed.
