    Fast‑track proceedings for sellers seeking possession when a buyer falls behind

  <p>
    A <strong>land‑contract forfeiture</strong> is a type of summary‑proceeding that lets the
    seller <em>(vendor)</em> recover possession of the property when the purchaser
    is in default.  Unlike mortgage foreclosure, forfeiture timelines are much
    shorter, but the purchaser still gets a statutory **redemption period** to
    catch up on payments.
